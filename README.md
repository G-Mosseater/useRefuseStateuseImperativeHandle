# useRefuseStateuseImperativeHandle


### This project is a playground for experimenting with React hooks like useRef, useState, and useImperativeHandle. I built a set of interactive components, including a timer challenge with multiple difficulty levels, a player name input, and a result modal that shows scores.

### I learned how to use useRef to store values that persist across renders /  for timers and input fields /without triggering unnecessary re-renders. I also explored managing state for dynamic UI updates, creating reusable components, and controlling ### modals with useImperativeHandle and createPortal.
